## Getting started

As a **user** you can install the app via our [website](https://timelet.org).

For **developers** the easiest way to get started is:

- Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) up and running
- Get [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) ready
- Open the project in the Remote Container and run `yarn start`
- A build can be created with `yarn build`. For testing purposes a local server can be started in the `build` directory with `python3 -m http.server`, if Python 3 is installed.

### Internationalization

Messages can be extracted for translation and compiled again for usage.

1. Extract messages with `yarn i18n:extract --out-file assets/i18n/en.json`.
1. Compile messages with `yarn i18n:compile assets/i18n/en.json --ast --out-file src/i18n/en.json`.
