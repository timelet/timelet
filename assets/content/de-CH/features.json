This feature allows users to maintain multiple synchronized copies of their time tracking data across different platforms or cloud services. Whether it's sharing specific project data with collaborators or integrating time tracking records into other productivity tools, the 'Distributed' capability enhances flexibility and data portability. Users can seamlessly work with their time data across various environments, making it easier to collaborate, analyze, and integrate their time tracking information with other workflows.",
